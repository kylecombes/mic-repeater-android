# Amplifying Doctors' Voices in the Fight Against COVID-19

In response to the shortage of N95 medical masks in early 2020, the Prakash Lab at Stanford University
led development of a novel face mask called [Pneumask](pneumask.org/) for use in the fight
against SARS-CoV-2 and [COVID-19](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus_disease_2019).

# This App

One downside of the mask is that it severely muffles the voice of the user, thereby inhibiting
communication and requiring the user to strain their voice to communicate with others in a noisy
environment. In order to help sound travel past the mask, we created a mobile app to relay audio from
a Bluetooth microphone inside the mask to speakers outside the mask. Sound can either be played on
the phone’s internal speakers or through speakers connected to the device’s wired headphone jack.

The app also provides links to the Pneumask project website with information on safety procedures.

# Using the app

 1. Connect phone to a Bluetooth device with a microphone. We recommend using cheap Bluetooth
    headphones, which can be put inside a sterile plastic bag, and placing them inside the face
    compartment of the snorkel mask. 
 2. (Optional, for extra amplification) Connect an external speaker to the phone’s wired headphone
    jack using an aux cord. If you do not do this, the phone will use its internal speakers.
 3. Open the app.
 4. Click “Start” to begin relaying audio from the microphone to the speaker.
 5. You may now turn off the phone’s screen or switch to another app if you would like. If you need
    to switch speakers at any point, click “Stop,” do any plugging/unplugging, and then click “Start.”
 6. Click “Stop” end relaying audio.
